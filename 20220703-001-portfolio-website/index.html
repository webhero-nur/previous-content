            <h3>Become a web developer</h3>
            <p>Learing is my passion. I like to explore new things regularly. I like to work alone but also can lead a
                team and follow a team leader very well. I can work with programming language like: <strong>C, C++,
                    Java, Python</strong> and scripting language like <strong>HTML, CSS</strong> etc. I am a good
                listener and have a good presentation skill.</p>
